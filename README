Drupal-vim is a simple drupal-friendly vim configuration example.
This is not a maintained distrubution but only an example of
how powerful can vim be with a fine tuned configuration.

REQUIREMENTS
you'll need
- ctags to generate tags for your project
- xdebug to use the debugger

It provides :
- drupal indentation style
- hooks autocompletion
- php statements autocompletion
- tags to jump to a function declaration like in Eclipse
- a php debugger

It contains two simple bash scripts to :
- generate tags for a project with Ctags (that will be stored to ~/.vim/tags directory)
- generate a dictionary for a project (that will be stored in dictionnaries directory).

You can check also "vimrc" project on drupal.org that now provides a vim plugin for Drupal.
